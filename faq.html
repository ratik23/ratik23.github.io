					<div class="question"><b>Q1. How do pandemics impact the Clinical Trials Process ?</b></div>
					<div class="answer">
						<p>
							In a serious, life-threatening situation where no medicine currently exists against a specific disease, such as during a pandemic, the clinical trial process can be ‘Fast-Tracked’. This is generally done with drugs that already show promise in combating the disease by having efficacy against related disorders. This process involves more regular meetings of the clinical trials governing body (ex. FDA) so that the drug can pass through stages faster, as well as the ability of the drug manufacturing company to submit sections of crucial documents as they are completed as opposed to once full stages of the trial are complete. Even in these circumstances, the clinical trial process is still extremely rigorous.

				<div class="faq">
					<div class="question"><b>Q2. What are the differences between vaccines and therapeutic drugs?</b></div>
					<div class="answer">
						<p>
							Vaccines are biological preparations that, when administered to an individual, provide protection
							from a specific entity, such as a virus or bacteria. Vaccines prime the immune system and create a
							form of memory, so that you can respond faster and with greater magnitude against a threat than if
							you were encountering it for the first time. Vaccines can be composed of proteins, nucleic acids
							(DNA and RNA), or even entire organisms and their potency can be boosted by chemicals known as
							adjuvants. Vaccines are most commonly used prophylactically (to prevent an infection or disease).

							Therapeutic Drugs are any molecules that are used to diagnose, treat or prevent a disease. Unlike
							vaccines, therapeutic drugs directly affect the disease in question or modulate the immune system
							to help deal with the disease, but provide no form of ‘memory’ that would help the body fight off
							the disease at a future encounter. They can be composed of numerous entities including chemicals,
							proteins, or nucleic acids.

				<div class="faq">
					<div class="question"><b>Q3. What is novel coronavirus?</b></div>
					<div class="answer">
						<p>
							Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses which may cause illness in animals or humans.  In
							humans, several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections ranging from the common
							cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute
							Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). The most recently discovered coronavirus causes coronavirus disease
							COVID-19.
						<p>
					</div>
				</div>

				<div class="faq">
					<div class="question"><b>Q4. Why is disease being called coronavirus disease 2019 or covid 19?</b></div>
					<div class="answer">
						<p>
							On February 11, 2020 the World Health Organization announced an official name for the disease
							that is causing the 2019 novel coronavirus outbreak, first identified in Wuhan China. The new name
							of this disease is coronavirus disease 2019, abbreviated as COVID-19. In COVID-19, ‘CO’ stands for
							‘corona,’ ‘VI’ for ‘virus,’ and ‘D’ for disease. 
							Formerly, this disease was referred to as “2019 novel
							coronavirus” or “2019-nCoV”.

							There are many types of human coronaviruses including some that commonly cause mild upper-
							respiratory tract illnesses. COVID-19 is a new disease, caused by a novel (or new) coronavirus that
							has not previously been seen in humans.
